		<p>This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics. You can create anything that makes you happy. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul.</p>
